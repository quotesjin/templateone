					<h1> Quotes that Change Your Life Completely</h1>

These faves all have something in common: they deliver love quotes that just make you melt as soon as you hear them. You know what I mean—it's that feeling you get when you see that scene in The Notebook where Noah tells Allie, "No matter what happens to us, every day spent with you is the best day of <a href="https://quotesjin.com/disappointment-quotes/">disappointment quotes</a>."

					<h2>Curabitur ullamcorper ultricies</h2>
					<p>I can't relate to these haters; my enemies never made it.
Send the haters all my love.
They say I'm old news. Well who the new star? Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far.
Never pay attention to the rumours and what they assume.
I can't hear the critics talking over the applause.
Please don't listen to the lies; I swear they all lie. You know I could be your knight in shining Armor All tires.
I am what everybody in my past doesn't want me to be.
I can't relate to these haters; my enemies never made it.
I'm a staple in my city; you can never ruin me.
Be assured those will be thy worst enemies, not to whom thou hast done evil, but who have done evil to thee.
Drake stands for Do Right and Kills Everything.
They are trying to shoot down my flight before it lands.
Suppose you were doing 16s when I was 16, and then your s*it flopped. And you switched teams, don't talk to me.
Sitting there, wishing their problems become ours, cause we have nothing in common since I done became a star.
I'm just feelin' like the throne is for the taking. Watch me take it.
<a href="https://quotesjin.com/attitude-quotes/">https://quotesjin.com/attitude-quotes/</a>

We've been living on a high; they've been talking on the low. But it's cool, know you heard it all before.
Got niggas reacting without a sinus cause what I'm working with is timeless.
It feels like rap changed. Back when a nigga reached, it was for a weapon. Nowadays, people come to sell their records. F*ck going platinum, I looked at my wrist, and it's already platinum.
The universe is just a verse of me, I keep it generic, and the niggas take it personally.
Started local but thanks to all the haters, I know G4 pilots on a first-name basis.
Emotions in this game run deep so before these haters kill me in my sleep I'd like to say, it's been a pleasure.
Haters broadcast your failure but whisper your success.
Take my verses too serious you hate me, cause I'm the one to paint a vivid picture, no HD.
But you could miss me with all that, diss me then crawl back. I wish you all would fall back, but getting rich suppose to solve that.
I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that.
I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty, disliked by some, but confronted by none.
They give me head while the haters provide me with promo.
You accomplish in a week what I’m daily required.
Drake quotes about friends
The rapper’s fans know that he addresses anyone he wishes to in his music. This includes real friends, fake friends, and backstabbers. Drake quotes about counterfeit friends hit home if you have ever had a friend turn on you. Through the lines, he reminds everyone that real friendships are rare, and people get betrayed by those close to them every time.

Bunch of handshake from the fakes but I don't want to be friends though
It takes a particular type of man to teach, to be far from the hood but understand the streets.
Friendship is like a song, some <a href="https://quotesjin.com/sad-quotes/">sad quotes</a>
 may be a hit and last forever, and some maybe be a waste of time and never to be heard again.
Quit playing; you didn't love me from the start. You're the reason why I feel this way; you broke my f*cking heart, and I gave you all my trust, and you just tore it all apart.
Nobody likes us except for us.
Started from the bottom, now we're here.
I live for the nights I can't remember with the people I won't forget.
No new friends.
You're my right hand.

I'm not saying you have to love me; I wish one day you will.
My team good, we don't need a mascot.
I still ride with my day one.
I can't see another squad trying to cross us.
Imagine if I never met the brookies?
And those will be thy best friends, not to whom thou hast done right but who have done well to thee.
Shout out to the homeowners, the girls that got diplomas and enough money to loan us.
Drake quotes about loyalty
Best Drake quotes are about loyalty and being there for each other. The rapper knows that people need each other to survive, and that is why time and again, he talks of trustworthiness and dependability. No one tells it better than the No New Friends rapper when it comes to talks about loyalty.

Backstabbed so many times I start to walk backwards.
And I love it when your hair still wet cause you look a shower. Running on a treadmill and only eating salad. Sound so smart like you.
Might have been a time when I loved her too, but you take that away, and you'll always be the one.
I’m more than just a number; I doubt you’ll find another. So every single summer, I’ll be the one that you remember.
No strings attached, your love is so WIFI.
I show love, never get the <a href="https://quotesjin.com/self-love-quotes/">self love quotes</a> same out of others. Fuck any nigga that's talking that sh*t to get a reaction.
Guess it's funny how money can make change out of people for real.
Some nobody started feelin' himself. A couple of somebodies started killin' themselves.
Graduated college, as you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard.
Rappers are emotional. Critics are reviewing me. But I got love for everybody even if you're suing me.

I meet quotas while you rappers are having sleepovers, spending nights in the studio trying to beat Hova.
The pressure on both hearts beats lie a metronome both in sync like a Justin song, feel so right, but it's just so wrong.
I tell patron truths; I tell you Henny lies.
My song is your girlfriends waking up ringer or alarm or whatever.
I’m not heartless, I’ve just learned how to use my heart less.
Drake quotes about life
If you listen to the rapper religiously, then you know that the rapper has many wise words about life. He advises people about different things in life. He does this by talking about his experiences and sharing the lessons he learnt through the experiences. Drake quotes about life talk about both wins and losses.

The game isn't always fair, and that's the thing though. You can play your heart out; everybody doesn't get a ring though.
You know life is what we make it, and a chance is like a picture, it'd be nice if you take it.
When all is said and done, more is always said than done.
Mind in one place, heart in another.
Still spending every dollar, they encourage me to save, but I’m good.
Look at where I landed; you would think I planned it. I’m just doing me, and you can never understand it.
Until you find yourself, it’s impossible to lose you. Because I never had you, although I would be glad to.
The best things in life are never rationed. Friendship, loyalty, love, do not require coupons.
Don't be afraid to give your best to what seemingly are small jobs. Every time you conquer one, it makes you that much stronger. If you do the little jobs well, the big ones will tend to take care of themselves.
Sometimes it’s the journey that teaches you a lot about your destination.
Everybody has an addiction; mine happens to be a success.
Was born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection.

When writing the story of your life, don’t let anyone else hold the pen.
Strength isn't always shown in what you can hold on to; sometimes it's shown in what you can let go of.
Life can always change; you have to <a href="https://quotesjin.com/quotes-about-strength/">strength quotes</a> adjust.
Before you give up, think of the reason you held on so long.
It's never too late to realize what you want in your life, and it's never wrong to fight for it.
I’m not confrontational, but if someone challenges, I’m not going to back down.
Pain makes you stronger. Fear makes you braver. Heartbreak makes you wiser.</p>

								<blockquote>
									<p>“Spring is way of saying: ‘Let’s party!’” – Robin Williams
“The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quiet, alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As long as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.” – Anne Frank</p>
